While there are many familiars in the 5 burroughs, few can call themselves true Sisters.
But our numbers are steadily growing. The path to Sisterhood begins with the blood of the
first sister - Sister Paul. Each month, a Sister can select 2 familiars to challenge her
for the chance to become a true Sister. The challenger must defeat that Sister, and each
Sister in her bloodline in a best of 3 gauntlet. If they are successful, they will be added
to that Sister's bloodline and are then allowed to offer their line to 2 familiars. If a
familiar should lose in any of their gauntlet, they must sit out until they are invited
once again. When a sister's 2 familiar slots are filled, they can no longer make the offer
of the blood of the Sisterhood.
