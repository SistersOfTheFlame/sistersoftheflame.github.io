25 Mages gathered for the first Sisters of the Flame tournament that we ran alongside<br>
GP New Jersey on October 27th, 2018 at Cheeseburger in Paradise. People came from all<br>
over the Tri State area to cast Protective Circles and conjure Capricious Djinni while<br>
donating, and competing for, an incredible community card pool. Our event was also run<br>
as a charity event in which all entry fees were donated to Women in Need, a non-profit<br>
that helps homeless mothers and their children with much needed shelter and supplies.<br>
<br>
On top of the community prize pool, we also assembled a collection of wiccan talismans,<br>
candles, and protection runes for the top 4, as well as an Unlimited Icy Manipulator and<br>
a hand-curated selection of fringe cards of every color awarded to the Most Creative Deck,<br>
donated and awarded by resident NYC brewmaster, Raging River.<br>

We played 5 rounds of Swiss and were left with one player who went undefeated when the<br>
dust had settled. Deck lists follow in order of placement.<br>

GP New Jersey 2018 was a wonderful event filled with old and new pals, strange brews,<br>
and all for a good cause. With our combined entry fees and a significant donation from<br>
Sister Erik, we were able to raise $500 for Women in Need!<br>
