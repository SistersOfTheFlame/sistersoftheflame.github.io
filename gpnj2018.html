GP New Jersey 2018
</h1>

<p style="font-family:courier; color:red; text-align:center;">
25 Mages gathered for the first Sisters of the Flame tournament that we ran alongside</b>
GP New Jersey on October 27th, 2018 at Cheeseburger in Paradise. People came from all</b>
over the Tri State area to cast Protective Circles and conjure Capricious Djinni while</b>
donating, and competing for, an incredible community card pool. Our event was also run</b>
as a charity event in which all entry fees were donated to Women in Need, a non-profit</b>
that helps homeless mothers and their children with much needed shelter and supplies.</b>
</b>
On top of the community prize pool, we also assembled a collection of wiccan talismans,</b>
candles, and protection runes for the top 4, as well as an Unlimited Icy Manipulator and</b>
a hand-curated selection of fringe cards of every color awarded to the Most Creative Deck,</b>
donated and awarded by resident NYC brewmaster, Raging River.</b>
</b>
We played 5 rounds of Swiss and were left with one player who went undefeated when the</b>
dust had settled. Deck lists follow in order of placement.</b>
